    "\n",
    "This cell introduces a custom class, `Distiller`, that implements the **knowledge distillation** training approach using Keras. Knowledge distillation aims to transfer knowledge from a large, accurate **teacher model** to a smaller, more efficient **student model**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Distiller Class Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:**\n",
    "  - Accepts two models:\n",
    "    - A pre-trained **teacher model** (larger, high-performance).\n",
    "    - A smaller **student model** (simpler, faster).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Compilation Parameters:**\n",
    "  - **Optimizer**: Used to update the student model's weights.\n",
    "  - **Metrics**: Metrics for evaluating the student model (e.g., accuracy).\n",
    "  - **Student loss function** (`student_loss_fn`): Measures how well the student predictions match the true labels (hard labels).\n",
    "  - **Distillation loss function** (`distillation_loss_fn`): Measures the difference between teacher and student predictions using softened probabilities (soft labels).\n",
    "  - **Alpha (`α`)**: Balances the contribution of the student loss and distillation loss:\n",
    "    - `loss = α * student_loss + (1 - α) * distillation_loss`\n",
    "  - **Temperature (`T`)**: Used to soften probability distributions, making it easier for the student model to learn from the teacher's predictions:\n",
    "    - Higher temperatures produce softer distributions, emphasizing relationships among classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom `train_step`:**\n",
    "  - Performs a forward pass with both teacher (no gradient) and student (gradient computed).\n",
    "  - Calculates two losses:\n",
    "    - **Student loss**: Measures the student's performance against true labels.\n",
    "    - **Distillation loss**: Encourages the student model to mimic the softened predictions of the teacher model.\n",
    "  - Combines losses using the factor `α`.\n",
    "  - Updates the student model parameters by backpropagating the combined loss.\n",
    "  - Updates and returns training metrics and individual loss values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom `test_step`:**\n",
    "  - Evaluates student model performance during validation or testing.\n",
    "  - Updates and returns evaluation metrics, including the student loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important Notes:**\n",
    "- Because the teacher model outputs probabilities (softmax), the implementation re-applies softmax after scaling by temperature. Although not mathematically ideal (logits would be preferred), this practical approach typically performs well.\n",
    "- Multiplying the distillation loss by `T²` (temperature squared) is a standard best practice from the original knowledge distillation paper by Hinton et al.\n",
